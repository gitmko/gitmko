### Hi There :wave:

The name's mko, I'm your average Linux desktop enjoyer who loves the command-line!

I like to make things __accessible__ while looking âœ¨ _neat_ âœ¨

ðŸ‘· Iâ€™m currently working on:
- My DWM configuration, [dwm-mko](https://github.com/gitmko/dwm-mko)
- A [Dotfiles Installer](https://github.com/gitmko/dotfiles-installer) with an emphasis on __ease of use__ âš¡

If you're still reading, why not follow me on [mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@mkayo)?
